During the development process of this project, I gained valuable experience in integrating APIs and building dynamic web pages. One of the main goals was to retrieve and display data about countries, including their neighboring countries, which required careful handling of API responses. At the beginning, I faced difficulties understanding how to properly use the API to fetch neighboring country information. The data structure was more complex than expected, and I had to experiment with different endpoints and parameters to get accurate results. After reviewing the API documentation and testing several approaches, I was able to implement a working solution that correctly displayed neighboring countries based on country codes.

Another major challenge was designing and implementing the second page, which was responsible for displaying detailed information about each selected country. Managing the navigation between pages and ensuring that data was passed correctly took some time to solve. I had to debug issues related to state management and asynchronous data loading. Eventually, I implemented a solution that used query parameters and API calls to dynamically load country details, improving both functionality and user experience.

Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of working with APIs and dynamic content rendering. If I were to improve the project further, I would focus on optimizing the API requests, adding error handling for failed responses, and improving the visual layout for better usability.
